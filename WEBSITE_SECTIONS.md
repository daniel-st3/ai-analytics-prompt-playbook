## Prompt Libraries
Your Prompt Libraries section should feel like a practical toolbox, not a random prompt dump. Position it as “copy, adapt, run” resources for analysts and BI builders. Keep examples tied to real tasks: EDA, SQL, KPI design, and automation planning.

**Suggested anchors:**
- Fraud Analytics Prompts
- SQL & BI Prompts
- n8n Automation Prompts
- Career & Portfolio Prompts

**CTA snippets:**
- Open on GitHub
- Copy prompt for Claude
- Use with ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis
- Try this in Gemini Advanced

## Claude Skills
This section should explain that Skills are reusable operating modes for Claude web/Claude Code. Emphasize inputs and outputs so users know exactly what to paste and what they will get back. Keep each Skill card action-oriented.

- n8n Workflow Architect
- BI Dashboard Architect
- Portfolio & README Editor
- Job Search Analyst

**CTA snippets:**

## Custom GPTs & Gemini Gems
Present this as two separate ecosystems so users do not mix setup instructions. For each tool, show target user, core capability, and guardrails in one screen. Keep examples short and role-specific.

**Suggested anchors:**
- Custom GPTs (ChatGPT)
- Gemini Gems
- Fraud Copilot Design
- Portfolio Assistant Design

**CTA snippets:**
- Open GPT blueprint

Mention that each guide includes first-run setup and first practical task, not only installation commands. Keep troubleshooting notes short and task-oriented.

**Suggested anchors:**
- Claude Setup
- ChatGPT ADA Setup
- Gemini Gems Setup
