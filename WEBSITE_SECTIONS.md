## Prompt Libraries
Position this section as a professional toolkit for analytics execution, not a generic prompt gallery. Make it clear that prompts are model-specific and workflow-oriented: Claude for structured planning, ChatGPT for reasoning + ADA execution, Gemini for long-context source grounding. Keep every page actionable with copy-ready blocks and verification checklists so users can run prompts safely in real project contexts.

**Suggested anchors:**
- Fraud Analytics Mega-Prompts
- SQL & BI Metrics Mega-Prompts
- n8n and Agent Automation Mega-Prompts
- Career and Portfolio Mega-Prompts
- Prompt Verification Checklist

**CTA snippets:**
- Open on GitHub
- Copy XML prompt for Claude
- Run with o1/o3 + ADA in ChatGPT
- Try this in Gemini Advanced
- Open troubleshooting prompts

## Claude Skills
Present Skills as reusable operating systems for Claude web Projects and Claude Code. Highlight that each Skill includes required inputs, expected outputs, edge-case handling, and XML-based system architecture. This framing shows technical maturity and makes the section recruiter-friendly because visitors can see process discipline, not just output examples.

**Suggested anchors:**
- EDA and SQL Coach Skill
- n8n Workflow Architect Skill
- BI Dashboard Architect Skill
- Portfolio and README Editor Skill
- Job Search Analyst Skill

**CTA snippets:**
- Open Skill spec
- Copy XML system prompt
- Use in Claude Project
- Use in Claude Code
- View sample inputs

## Custom GPTs & Gemini Gems
Keep this section split into two independent ecosystems to avoid setup confusion. For Custom GPTs, show behavior rules like knowledge base semantic retrieval before answering. For Gemini Gems, highlight source-grounded outputs plus native Google Workspace context across Drive, Docs, and Sheets where applicable.

**Suggested anchors:**
- Custom GPTs (ChatGPT)
- Gemini Gems (Gemini Advanced)
- Knowledge Base Retrieval Patterns
- Google Workspace Grounding Patterns
- Guardrails and Limitations

**CTA snippets:**
- Open GPT blueprint
- Build this GPT in ChatGPT
- Open Gem instruction text
- Try this in Gemini Advanced
- Compare model behavior

## Tutorials & Guides
Design this area like a learning path with practical outcomes and clear time boxes. Every tutorial should include iterative workflows, model-specific prompts, and explicit hallucination-recovery prompts so users can debug bad SQL, wrong grain, or broken code quickly. Keep each guide scannable but execution-ready.

**Suggested anchors:**
- Fraud Notebook in 45 Minutes
- n8n Analytics Command Center Guide
- Portfolio and README in One Evening
- Troubleshooting and Hallucination Handling
- Model-Specific Execution Patterns

**CTA snippets:**
- Start tutorial
- Copy step prompts
- Open troubleshooting block
- Open code commands
- View portfolio-ready output

## Installation & Setup Guides
Explain that setup docs cover first run and first useful output, not only installation commands. Include practical onboarding flows for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, n8n, and Python, with verification checks at each stage. Add short troubleshooting references so users can recover quickly from environment mismatches.

**Suggested anchors:**
- Claude Setup (Web and Code)
- ChatGPT Setup (o1/o3 + ADA)
- Gemini Setup (Advanced and Gems)
- n8n Setup and First Workflow
- Python Analytics Environment Setup
