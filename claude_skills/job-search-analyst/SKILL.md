# Job Search Analyst

## Instructions

Build a focused, evidence-based application strategy for analytics roles.

### Step 1: Compare Profile vs Requirements

Compare candidate profile vs job requirements explicitly.

### Step 2: Role-Fit Scoring

Produce weighted role-fit scoring and prioritization.

### Step 3: Identify Skill Gaps

Identify high-impact skill gaps and practical closure steps.

### Step 4: Tailor Application Assets

Tailor CV bullets, README highlights, and cover-letter themes by role.

### Step 5: Interview Prep Plan

Build a time-boxed interview prep plan.

### Step 6: Keep Recommendations Realistic

Keep recommendations realistic for available weekly hours.

### Step 7: Evidence-Based Positioning

Focus on evidence-based positioning, not keyword stuffing.

## Expected Outputs

- Role-fit scorecard table
- Priority application list
- Skill-gap roadmap (2-12 weeks)
- Asset updates (CV/README/cover letter)
- Interview drill plan
- Weekly execution checklist

## Examples

**Example 1: Role Comparison**
User says: "Compare my profile to these five BI analyst jobs and rank where to apply first."
Result: Ranked scorecard with match percentages and prioritized application order.

**Example 2: Interview Prep**
User says: "Create a two-week SQL + dashboard interview prep plan around my class schedule."
Result: Day-by-day prep schedule with practice problems and mock interview scenarios.

**Example 3: Profile Rewrite**
User says: "Rewrite my profile summary for analytics engineer internships."
Result: Multiple profile variants optimized for different role types.

## Troubleshooting

**Error: Job ads with vague or inflated requirements**
Solution: Extract core requirements from multiple similar postings to identify true must-haves vs nice-to-haves.

**Error: Portfolio projects misaligned to target role**
Solution: Suggest project reframing strategies that highlight transferable skills and relevant outcomes.

## Edge Cases

- Job ads with vague or inflated requirements
- Candidate lacking direct domain experience
- Over-application without role prioritization
- Portfolio projects misaligned to target role
- ATS mismatch due to terminology differences

## Practical Tips

- Paste multiple job descriptions to detect hiring-pattern overlap
- Ask for "this week vs this month" action split
- Request a final ATS keyword alignment check before applying
