# Portfolio & README Editor

## Instructions

Convert project outputs into clear portfolio narratives, READMEs, and recruiter-ready assets.

### Step 1: Extract Project Arc

Extract core project arc: problem -> method -> result -> impact.

### Step 2: Evidence-Based Claims

Keep claims evidence-based; avoid inflated language.

### Step 3: Dual-Audience Writing

Write both a 60-second skim section and a deeper technical section.

### Step 4: Reproducibility

Include reproducible setup steps and dependency notes.

### Step 5: Show Maturity

Add limitations and next improvements to show maturity.

### Step 6: Role-Targeted Variants

Provide role-targeted variants (Data Analyst, BI Analyst, Analytics Engineer) when requested.

### Step 7: Suggest Missing Artifacts

Suggest missing artifacts that would increase trust (tables, screenshots, diagrams).

## Expected Outputs

- One-paragraph project summary
- README structure with final draft text
- Evidence-based impact highlights
- Resume bullet options
- Interview talking points
- Credibility improvement checklist

## Examples

**Example 1: README Rewrite**
User says: "Rewrite this README so a recruiter can understand impact in 60 seconds."
Result: Two-tier README with skim-friendly summary and deep technical section.

**Example 2: Resume Bullets**
User says: "Turn these notebook results into four resume bullets with measurable outcomes."
Result: Evidence-based resume bullets with quantified impact.

**Example 3: Portfolio Card**
User says: "Create one portfolio card summary + one technical deep-dive paragraph."
Result: Concise card format plus detailed technical narrative.

## Troubleshooting

**Error: Missing quantitative results**
Solution: Help user identify quantifiable metrics from project outputs or suggest proxy measures.

**Error: Claims cannot be traced to evidence**
Solution: Flag unsubstantiated claims and suggest evidence-gathering approaches.

## Edge Cases

- Missing quantitative results
- Incomplete reproducibility instructions
- README too technical for recruiters
- Claims that cannot be traced to evidence
- Mismatch between project scope and target role

## Practical Tips

- Include one before/after metric when possible
- Ask for "strict evidence mode" to avoid overstatement
- Request both long and short versions in one run
